# Project Spec Suite for My-Blog-App  
This directory controls project structure, coding conventions, and documentation policies for the blog/social-blog project using Next.js 16, React, and TypeScript.

## How to use  
- Each file defines a single aspect (structure, coding style, docs, etc.).  
- Before starting a new feature: read the relevant spec file.  
- For code reviews: use specs as “linting + architecture + style check” guidelines.  

## Why this separation  
- Maintains clarity and modularity.  
- Easier to update one aspect without touching others.  
- Better traceability for decisions, and easier to onboard other developers.
