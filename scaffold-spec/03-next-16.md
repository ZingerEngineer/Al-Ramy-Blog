# Next.js 16 Conventions & Best Practices

Rules and best practices tailored for Next.js 16 (App Router, caching, routing, bundler, etc.).

## Routing & Folder Structure

- Use **App Router**: place all pages, layouts, route-handlers inside `/app/`.  
- Use **file-system routing**: each folder in `/app/` corresponds to a route segment.
- For grouping without affecting URLs, use **route-groups** (folders named like `(groupName)`) — good for organizing internal code.  
- For code not meant to be routable (utils, private components, etc.), use private folders prefixed `_` or place them outside `/app/`.

## Backend / API / Data Fetching

- Use **Route Handlers** (`route.ts` / `route.js`) under `/app/` for API endpoints and server logic.
- Do not mix UI and API logic in the same file.
- For data fetching in pages/layouts: use **Server Components**, or fetch inside route handlers / server functions, keeping separation from UI.

## Caching & Rendering

- Take advantage of Next.js 16 caching APIs (`revalidateTag()`, `cache` directive, etc.) for data that doesn’t change often.  
- For dynamic or user-specific data: avoid caching or use cache invalidation mechanisms.  
- Use Server Components for heavy logic or data fetching to minimize client bundle size and improve performance.

## Bundler & Build

- Use **Turbopack** (default in Next.js 16) for faster development builds and optimized bundling.  
- Keep configuration minimal — avoid heavy customizations unless necessary.

## Private / Shared Code Structure

- Shared code (utilities, helpers, types, services) should be outside route folders — either under `/lib`, `/services`, `/types`, etc.  
- Prevent accidental route exposure by using private folders or placing shared code at root-level directories.  
- Maintain shallow folder nesting for readability and easier navigation.

## Versioning & Environment Setup

- Use `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `.env.local` (plus other env variants) for configuration.  
- Keep configuration centralized in `/config` where appropriate (constants, feature flags, env wrappers).

## Documentation & Conventions

- For any architectural decision, caching strategy, or major feature, document in `/docs`.  
- Maintain a **style-guide**, **api-design**, and **architecture** docs referencing routing, caching, data fetching, rendering strategy.  
- Keep naming consistent and clear — routes, folders, files, components, utilities, services.
